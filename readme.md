### Description
Web application for employee information management. Working with the application is based on adding, changing and deleting information about workers. Search by first name and/or last name is also available. The system is organized as a table sorted by person's last name. Access to the functionality of the application is provided after logging in.
After registration, specific functions are available to the user depending on the authority.
The administrator has access to all the functionality of the program, while a user with the manager role is limited to adding a new employee and changing information about him.

The application is not limited to the current state and will be expanded by adding new features in the future.
